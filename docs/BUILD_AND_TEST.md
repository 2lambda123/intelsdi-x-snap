 
# Build and Test
## Getting Started
To build snap you'll need:
* [Golang >= 1.4](https://golang.org)
    * Golang should be [downloaded](https://golang.org/dl/), and (installed](https://golang.org/doc/install)
      The below instructions assume that the GOPATH environment variable has been set.
    * An option to look into is using the [go version manager (gvm)](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) if you want to easily switch between Go versions.
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

* snap:
    * Install snap into your `$GOPATH`.

    ```
    go get github.com/intelsdi-x/snap`.
    ```

    * `cd` into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap` and set your fork as a remote repository.

    ```
    git remote rename origin upstream
    ```

    ```
    git remote add origin git@github.com:<yourGithubID>/snap.git
    ```

    * To push to your fork later, either do a `git push origin master` or do `git checkout -b <someBranchName>` then you can do `git push`.

## Build

Godeps is a dependency for running the make task(s) required for the build process. If it is not already installed,
install it into your GOPATH and ensure that its built executables are in your PATH.

```
# first check to see if it is installed
which godep
# install it if necessary
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin/
go get github.com/tools/godep
```

In the /snap directory there's a `Makefile` that builds all dependencies and snap.
To get dependencies and build snap just run:  

```
make
```

It runs the following `make deps` and `make all` commands.

Alternatively, you can run `make` with any of the following targets:

* `default`: runs make deps and make all
* `deps`: fetches all dependencies using godeps
* `check`: runs test suite
* `all`: builds snapd, snapctl, and the test plugins
* `snap` builds snapd and snapctl
* `install`: installs snapd and snapctl binaries in /usr/local/bin
* `release`: cuts a snap release

To update your branch with changes from the intelsdi-x master branch run:
```
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

To see how to run snap, look at [running snap](../README.md#running-snap), [SNAPD.md](SNAPD.md), and [SNAPCTL.md](SNAPCTL.md).

## Test
### Creating Tests
Our tests are written using [smartystreets' GoConvey package](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey).  See https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki for an introduction to creating a test.

### Running Tests
#### In local machine
First you need to run the following to get all test dependencies (this runs ./scripts/test.sh as well):
```
make test
```
To run all tests in order (it will stop at any failure in a directory before continuing on):  
```
./scripts/test.sh
```
To run all tests *and to continue through all directories even with errors*:  
```
go test ./...
```  
Tests can be pruned in go test with the `-run` option:
```
go test ./... -v -run <TestName>
```

e.g. `TestLoad` from `control_test.go`:
```
go test ./... -v -run TestLoad
```

e.g. using GoConvey UX:
```
go test -coverprofile=/tmp/coverage.out && go tool cover -html=/tmp/coverage.out
```

#### In Docker
You need to have Docker Engine installed. Visit [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for detailed instructions on how to do it.
If you're using Docker on OS X(Darwin) you need to have an active Docker host and the env var, `$DOCKER_HOST`, needs to be exported. 

There's a `Dockerfile` located at `./scripts/Dockerfile`:
```
FROM golang:latest  
ENV GOPATH=$GOPATH:/app
ENV SNAP_PATH=/go/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/build
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y install facter
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/
RUN git clone https://github.com/intelsdi-x/gomit.git
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap
ADD . /go/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap
RUN go get github.com/tools/godep && \
    go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports && \
    go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet && \
    go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/cover && \
    go get github.com/smartystreets/goconvey
RUN scripts/deps.sh
RUN make
```
This is run in the snap directory using `./scripts/run_tests_with_docker.sh`  
```
#!/bin/bash -e

docker build -t intelsdi-x/snap-test -f scripts/Dockerfile .
docker run -it intelsdi-x/snap-test scripts/test.sh
```
